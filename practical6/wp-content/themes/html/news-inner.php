                            <p>Blockchain Evolution Inc. ("Blockchain Evolution or the Company") announces that Blockchain Evolution Inc (“Blockchain Evolution”), has recently achieved several critical milestones in its five-project development program, with substantial progress having been made by its software team during the last four months. Blockchain Evolution is now seeking $10 million funding to coincide with its proposed listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”).</p>
                            <p>Blockchain Evolution intends to seek a $10 million private placement to provide funding to complete project development and to launch the five projects in their respective markets. The private placement will coincide with an application to list Blockchain Evolution on the CSE. There is no guarantee that the private placement will be completed or that the CSE application will be approved.</p>
                            <p>Unlike all other blockchains, which are based on anonymity, Blockchain Evolution’s unique blockchain, EvolveChain, is based on each participant on the blockchain being identified (per KYC banking norms), before the user can transact with others on the blockchain. Each participant’s confidential personal information is kept private and secure, and in a non-hackable format. A unique identifier allows the participants to access only their own profiles, which they can use to transact with others on the blockchain. As a result, an identifiable auditable record of transactions across the ecosystem is recorded on the blockchain while maintaining the confidential KYC information of each participant in a secure environment.</p>
                            <p class="bold">Xbook</p>
                            <p>Xbook is a user-permissioned social media platform empowering users to control access to their personal data. 50% of all Xbook revenue is shared with Xbook users. Revenue is shared pro-rata with each users’ individual views of advertising. Xbook is the answer to the privacy issues that have plagued Facebook, as Xbook users will have total control of any access to their data. Xbook utilizes eKYC-ID (electronic Know Your Customer identification) blockchain technology to provide the critical user identification infrastructure that is needed to accurately and securely record data for both users and advertisers.</p>
                            <p>Xbook has three access levels, all of which are free to the user, who can upload data via a mobile app. At Level One the Xbook user provides basic identification information and receives a limited revenue sharing cash income stream, together with a credit balance which is available when upgrading to Level Two. At Level Two the Xbook user provides enhanced identification information, which can be shared with advertisers only at the users’ discretion. As Level Two information is more valuable to Xbook advertisers, it generates for the Xbook user a cash income stream equal to 50% of the Xbook revenue attributable to that specific user. At Level Three the Xbook user provides full KYC identification data (similar to the data provided when opening a bank account), and thereby creates a personal online digital identity. The user digital identity is recorded securely on the Xbook blockchain, and can be utilized exclusively by the user for multiple commercial and governmental purposes. At all times it is the Xbook user who decides who has access to partial or complete digital data.</p>
                            <p class="bold">India Healthcare Platform</p>
                            <p>The Indian government has announced a universal health care system that will initially provide coverage to about 500 million citizens. Blockchain Evolution is in discussions with the Government of India to provide its blockchain technology as the framework for the new Indian healthcare system. EvolveChain will be utilized to record eKYC-ID patient data on a centralized blockchain and the patient will grant permission to doctors, hospitals, insurance companies etc to access some or all of that data on an as-needed basis. A pilot scheme to provide proof-of-concept in one Indian state is intended to commence during the last quarter of 2018. Blockchain Evolution has received a proposal from a publicly listed Indian technology company with a market cap of $12.6 billion, to acquire 15% of the Blockchain Evolution Indian healthcare project alone at a India Healthcare project valuation of $43.5 million.</p>
